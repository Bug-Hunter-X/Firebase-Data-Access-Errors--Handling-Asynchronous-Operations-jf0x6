The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you're trying to access the data within a callback function that is triggered before the data has been retrieved from the server. For example, if you use `.get()` without waiting for the promise to resolve, accessing the data will result in undefined values or errors.  Another instance is when using `onSnapshot` where the initial snapshot might not contain all expected data immediately.
